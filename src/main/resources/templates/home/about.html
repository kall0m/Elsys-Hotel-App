                            Our project’s main purpose is to help the hotel employers managing the job of their different kind of employees all of the time. The technology has two versions – WEB and Mobile application, which are based on Java Spring and Basic for Android. Because of its initial idea and main purpose, and because of the fact if you are a guest and do not have an account you have limited privileges such as reading the “About us” page that gives you the bare minimum for using the application and for our activity (who are we, how you can contact us,  etc.). If you want to use the services we provide you have to create your own account by visiting the “Register” page. So what exactly is the amount of information you need to share with us? You have to give us the name of the hotel you are in charge of, your(or the hotel’s official) e-mail address, choose a password, and of course select the type of subscription that mostly suits your professional needs. Now, If you chose the free trial it is simple, you will receive a confirmation email which will let you activate your account but if you chose option “10$” or “20$” first thing you will need to do is pay the required price by using your PayPal. Let me remind you that the WEB version is designed for the BOSS accounts. When you have already logged in what you can actually do? You’ll see that you have some buttons. You can generate free accounts for your employees by clicking “Add Worker” as long as you do not exceed the count that your subscription allows you. For the free trial you have the right to create five workers and distribute them by five different positions(ex: cleaner, cooker, maid and so on). Similarly for the second one – you are granted 10 types of position and 20 workers and for the last – 12 types and 35 workers. Разределението им става само и единствено по ваша преценка – може да изразходвате всичките си служители за един пост, да ги разпределите поравно на всеки или както намерите за добре. Не ви ограничаваме по никакъв начин. Their usernames and passwords are automatically generated by our system. If you want to преквалифицирате someone you must delete their account first and then generate them a new one. From the “Tasks” page you will be able to create new tasks which will have some description – what the конкретният служител has to do and the task’s current status – which by default is “To do”. When someone accepts it is immediately changed to “Doing” and finally – “Done”. We want to point out that when it is finished the task will not be permanently deleted so at the end of the exact day, week or month the manager can keep an eye on what each worker has done. That is basically all about the WEB Version. Now about the Android. There you can also log in as a BOSS with approximately the same privileges but as opposed to the site it is mainly designed for the workers. When logged in – they will not only be able to assign just to the tasks that matches their positions, but they won’t be bothered by seeing the others. Assuming the fact that some of them may have misclicked  and chose the wrong one, the employees can also refuse the execution and last but not least they have the right to change its status when done. There can be maximum three taken tasks and you can accept a new one when the previous are all finished with(or cancelled). The worker status is “free” or “busy”(if even only one task is taken).
